Understanding the Assignment
---
The _Assignment1.pdf_ will give a basic understanding of the assignment.  
However the following explanation by [Felipe Faria](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/profiles/ddf9f23a4daeae8f2fcd267b7d724289) on this [post](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/programming/KOo3V/scrooge-coin/discussions/threads/Yu1-ncdjEeaQDgq_dR_6Tg/replies/-DEdGseoEeaQDgq_dR_6Tg) makes it a lot easier to comprehend.

I have reproduced the answer as is in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/debanshu/eab9ccf8376eb2ce270638610329fabf) as a saved reference.
